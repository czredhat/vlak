Game vlak.com from the legendary Czech author Miroslav Němeček.

## How to build

First of all make sure you have correct environment:

* Run build within real DOS. For example DosBox does troubles with running bat files.
* Make sure you have Turbo Assembler installed and you can run `tasm` and `tlink` at your computer.

Building steps:

1. Run `RUZNE.BAT` for RUZNE.SCR creation.
1. Run `VAGONY.BAT` for VAGONY.SCR creation.
1. Run `VECI.BAT` for VECI.SCR creation.
1. Finally run `A.BAT` which will put all together and will make VLAK.COM.
